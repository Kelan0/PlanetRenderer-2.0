# PlanetRenderer-2.0
Remaking my original planet rendering engine, but much improved.

The original engine was a first attempt, and many things were done wrong, or done in a very limiting fashion. For example, there was no way of actually providing colouring or height information for anything more than a per-vertex resolution. In order to do this, it would require a major overhaul of how the engine works at a fundamental level. It was a learning experience though, and I was able to apply what I have learned to remaking a new and improved engine.
